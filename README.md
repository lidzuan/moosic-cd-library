# moosic-cd-library

Coded in Java, this project was completed for "STIA1123 Programming 2" in July 2023. The attached PDF contains the full project report.

## Project Description

The Moosic CD Library system provides users with a user-friendly GUI-based application coded in Java for efficient management of their CD collection. Leveraging various swing controls and containers, including text fields, panels, combo boxes, and buttons, the system allows users to seamlessly view, add, search for, update, and delete CD information. Statistical insights, such as the total number of CDs, total copies, average unit price, and the total value of the collection, are calculated and displayed. Employing the ArrayList data structure ensures an organised and efficient handling of CD data, and allows users to add an unlimited number of CDs to the library. The program incorporates exception handling to prevent unexpected crashes, offering informative feedback for potential input or file-related errors. Additionally, CD information is persistently stored in a local text file, enabling users to seamlessly pick up from where they left off across program runs.
